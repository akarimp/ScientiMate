.. code:: MATLAB

    [swanvectorvariable, Vxpoint, Vypoint] = swanvectorvarspvariedsct(xgrid, ygrid, xpoint, ypoint, Vx, Vy, savedata, outfilename, outfilelocation, CalcMethod)

Description
-----------

Generate SWAN file for spatially varied vector variable from scattered input data

Inputs
------

xgrid
    x (longitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
ygrid
    y (latitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
xpoint
    | x (longitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that vector variable is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
ypoint
    | y (latitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that vector variable is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
Vx
    | Variable in x direction (x component of input variable) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    |     1st row (i.e. [1,:]) is 1st time step, 2nd row (i.e. [2,:]) is 2nd time step, ...
    |     Example: windvel(1,:) is the wind velocity data for all points at the first time step
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind velocity is known in those locations
    |     L should be L>=3
    |     1st column (i.e. [:,1]) is 1st point, 2nd column (i.e. [:,2]) is 2nd point, 3rd column (i.e. [:,3]) is 3rd point, ...
    |     Example: windvel(:,1) is the wind velocity data for all time steps at the first point
Vy
    | Variable in y direction (y component of input variable) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    |     1st row (i.e. [1,:]) is 1st time step, 2nd row (i.e. [2,:]) is 2nd time step, ...
    |     Example: windvel(1,:) is the wind velocity data for all points at the first time step
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind velocity is known in those locations
    |     L should be L>=3
    |     1st column (i.e. [:,1]) is 1st point, 2nd column (i.e. [:,2]) is 2nd point, 3rd column (i.e. [:,3]) is 3rd point, ...
    |     Example: windvel(:,1) is the wind velocity data for all time steps at the first point
savedata='no';
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwind.wnd'
    | outfilename should have proper name and extension
outfilelocation=pwd;
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python
CalcMethod='linear';
    | Interpolation method 
    | 'linear': Use default or 'linear' method to interpolate
    | 'nearest': Use nearest neighbor method to interpolate

Outputs
-------

swanvectorvariable
    | Spatially varied vector variable data formated for SWAN
    | Vector variable data at each time step is assigned into the grid points
Vxpoint
    | Nearest interpolated vector variable in x direction at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that vector variable in x direction is known in those locations
Vypoint
    | Nearest interpolated vector variable in y direction at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that vector variable in y direction is known in those locations

Examples
--------

.. code:: MATLAB

    [xgrid,ygrid]=meshgrid(linspace(-91,-90,100),linspace(28,30,100));
    windvelx=[[10.5,10.55,10.6];[10.64,10.69,10.74];[10.7,10.75,10.8];[10.4,10.45,10.5]]; %Data for 4 time steps
    windvely=[[1.5,1.55,1.6];[1.64,1.69,1.74];[1.7,1.75,1.8];[1.4,1.45,1.5]]; %Data for 4 time steps
    xpoint=[-90.5;-90.3;-90.7]; %Data are known at 3 locations
    ypoint=[29.2;29;28.8]; %Data are known at 3 locations
