swanwindspvariedgrid
====================

.. code:: MATLAB

    [swanwind] = swanwindspvariedgrid(xgrid, ygrid, xpointgrid, ypointgrid, windvelgrid, winddirgrid, winddirtype, windvelmin, savedata, outfilename, outfilelocation, CalcMethod)

Description
-----------

Generate SWAN wind file for spatially varied wind from gridded input data

Inputs
------

xgrid
    x (longitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
ygrid
    y (latitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
xpointgrid
    x (longitude) of the locations that wind is known in those locations as a [K*L] array
ypointgrid
    y (latitude) of the locations that wind is known in those locations as a [K*L] array
windvelgrid
    | Wind velocity at (xpointgrid,ypointgrid) as a [K*L*P] array
    | P is number of time steps for a time series
winddirgrid
    | Wind direction at (xpointgrid,ypointgrid) as a [K*L*P] array in (Degree)
    | P is number of time steps for a time series
winddirtype='mete';
    | Define wind direction type
    | 'mete': meteorological wind direction 
    |     Meteorological direction represents a direction wind comes from and is measured counter-clockwise from the North
    |     0 (degree): from North, 90 (degree): from East, 180 (degree): from South, 270 (degree): from West
    | 'trig': trigonometric wind direction
windvelmin=0;
    Minimum allowed wind velocity
savedata='no';
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwind.wnd'
    | outfilename should have '.wnd' extension
outfilelocation=pwd;
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python
CalcMethod='linear';
    | Interpolation method 
    | 'linear': Use default or 'linear' method to interpolate
    | 'nearest': Use nearest neighbor method to interpolate

Outputs
-------

swanwind
    | Spatially varied wind velocity data formated for SWAN
    | Wind velocity data at each time step is assigned into the grid points

Examples
--------

.. code:: MATLAB

    [xgrid,ygrid]=meshgrid(linspace(-91,-90,100),linspace(28,30,100));
    [xpointgrid,ypointgrid]=meshgrid(linspace(-92,-89,100),linspace(27,31,100));
    windvelgrid=10+(12-10).*rand(100,100,4); %Data for 4 time steps
    winddirgrid=60+(65-60).*rand(100,100,4); %Data for 4 time steps
    winddirtype='mete';
    windvelmin=2.5;
    savedata='no';
    outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    outfilelocation=pwd;
    CalcMethod='linear';
    [swanwind]=swanwindspvariedgrid(xgrid,ygrid,xpointgrid,ypointgrid,windvelgrid,winddirgrid,winddirtype,windvelmin,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod);


    [xgrid,ygrid]=meshgrid(linspace(-91,-90,100),linspace(28,30,100));
    [xpointgrid,ypointgrid]=meshgrid(linspace(-92,-89,100),linspace(27,31,100));
    windvelgrid=10+(12-10).*rand(100,100); %Data for 1 time step
    winddirgrid=60+(65-60).*rand(100,100); %Data for 1 time step
    winddirtype='mete';
    windvelmin=2.5;
    savedata='no';
    outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    outfilelocation=pwd;
    CalcMethod='linear';
    [swanwind]=swanwindspvariedgrid(xgrid,ygrid,xpointgrid,ypointgrid,windvelgrid,winddirgrid,winddirtype,windvelmin,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod);
