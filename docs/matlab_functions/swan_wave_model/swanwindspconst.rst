swanwindspconst
===============

.. code:: MATLAB

    [swanwind] = swanwindspconst(windvel, winddir, winddirtype, windvelmin, savedata, outfilename, outfilelocation)

Description
-----------

Generate SWAN wind file for spatially constant wind

Inputs
------

windvel
    | Wind velocity
    | If size of windvel>1, then it is considered as a time series
    | 1st element is 1st time step, 2nd element is 2nd time step, ...
winddir
    Wind direction in (Degree)
winddirtype='mete';
    | Define wind direction type
    | 'mete': meteorological wind direction 
    |     Meteorological direction represents a direction wind comes from and is measured counter-clockwise from the North
    |     0 (degree): from North, 90 (degree): from East, 180 (degree): from South, 270 (degree): from West
    | 'trig': trigonometric wind direction
windvelmin=0;
    Minimum allowed wind velocity
savedata='no';
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwind.wnd'
    | outfilename should have '.wnd' extension
outfilelocation=pwd;
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python

Outputs
-------

swanwind
    | Spatially constant wind data formated for SWAN
    | Note: Wind at each time step is assigned into 4 points,
    |     assuming the wind domain is defined by 4 points, one at each corner

Examples
--------

.. code:: MATLAB

    windvel=[10.5;10.6;10.55]; %Data for 3 time steps
    winddir=[30;32;28]; %Data for 3 time steps
    winddirtype='mete';
    windvelmin=2.5;
    savedata='no';
    outfilename='swanwind.wnd';
    outfilelocation=pwd;
    [swanwind]=swanwindspconst(windvel,winddir,winddirtype,windvelmin,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation);
