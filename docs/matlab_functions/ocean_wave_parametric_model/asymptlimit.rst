asymptlimit
===========

.. code:: MATLAB

    [EhatAsympt, fphatAsympt, hhat] = asymptlimit(windvel, hmean, CalcMethod)

Description
-----------

Calculate dimensionless asymptotic limits of wind wave growth in shallow and intermediate water

Inputs
------

windvel
    | Wind velocity in (m/s)
    | Wind velocity should be measured (or represents velocity) at 10 m above surface
    | Wind velocity should be a 10 minutes averaged wind for all methods, except for for 'spmshallow' methods
    | For 'spmshallow' methods, wind velocity should be converted to duration of sustained wind by using gust factor
Fetch
    Wind fetch in (m)
hmean
    Mean water depth along a wind fetch in (m)
CalcMethod='karimpour';
    | Parametric wave model to be used for calculation 
    | 'smb': Use SMB method by Munk (1947), and Bretschneider (1952, 1958)
    | 'young': Use method by Young and Verhagen (1996) and Young and Babanin (2006)
    | 'karimpour': Use method by Karimpour et al. (2017)

Outputs
-------

EhatAsympt
    Dimensionless asymptotic limit values for wave energy, Ehat=g^2*m0/U10^4
fphatAsympt
    Dimensionless asymptotic limit values for peak wave frequency, fphat=fp*U10/9.81 
hhat
    | Dimensionless water depth along a wind fetch: hhat=g*hmean/U10^2
    | Note, g=9.81: gravitational acceleration
    |     U10: wind velocity
    |     fp: peak wave frequency
    |     hmean: mean depth along a wind fetch

Examples
--------

.. code:: MATLAB

    windvel(:,1)=10.*rand(100,1);
    hmean(:,1)=3.*rand(100,1);
    [EhatAsympt,fphatAsympt,hhat]=asymptlimit(windvel,hmean,'karimpour');
