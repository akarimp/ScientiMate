Introduction
============

ScientiMate is a **coastal** and **ocean** data analysis library.
ScientiMate is a collection of functions and tools (in **MATLAB** and **Python**) developed for **metocean**, oceanography, coastal engineering, and earth science data analysis.
The examples of ScientiMate's applications are (but not limited to) ocean wave analysis, time series data analysis, signal processing, wind engineering, etc.
