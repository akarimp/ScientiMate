scientimate.parametricwaveshallow
=================================

.. code:: python

    H, T, Ehat, fphat, m0, Fetchhat, hhat = scientimate.parametricwaveshallow(windvel, Fetch, hmean, CalcMethod='karimpour', dispout='no')

Description
-----------

Calculate wave properties using parametric wave models in shallow and intermediate water

Inputs
------

windvel
    | Wind velocity in (m/s)
    | Wind velocity should be measured (or represents velocity) at 10 m above surface
    | Wind velocity should be a 10 minutes averaged wind for all methods, except for for 'spmshallow' methods
    | For 'spmshallow' methods, wind velocity should be converted to duration of sustained wind by using gust factor
Fetch
    Wind fetch in (m)
hmean
    Mean water depth along a wind fetch in (m)
CalcMethod='karimpour'
    | Parametric wave model to be used for wave calculation 
    | 'spmshallow': Use method by Shore Protection Manual (SPM),
    |     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1984) in shallow and intermediate water water
    | 'young': Use method by Young and Verhagen (1996) and Young and Babanin (2006)
    | 'karimpour': Use method by Karimpour et al. (2017)
dispout='no'
    Define to display outputs or not ('yes': display, 'no': not display)

Outputs
-------

H
    | Predicted wave height in (m) 
    | For all methods: H=Hm0 where, Hm0 is a zero-moment wave height
T
    | Predicted wave period in (s) 
    | For all methods excepth for 'spmshallow': T=Tp where, Tp is a peak wave period
    | For 'spmshallow' method: T=Ts, where Ts is a significant wave period (Ts=0.95Tp)
Ehat
    Predicted dimensionless wave energy, Ehat=g^2*m0/U10^4
fphat
    Predicted dimensionless peak wave frequency, fphat=fp*U10/g
m0
    Zero-moment of water surface elevation power spectral density in (m^2)
Fetchhat
    Dimensionless wind fetch: Fetchhat=g*Fetch/U10^2
hhat
    | Dimensionless mean water depth along a wind fetch: hhat=g*hmean/U10^2
    | Note, g=9.81: gravitational acceleration
    |     U10: wind velocity
    |     fp: peak wave frequency
    |     hmean: mean depth along a wind fetch

Examples
--------

.. code:: python

    import scientimate as sm
    import numpy as np

    windvel=10*np.random.rand(100)
    Fetch=10000*np.random.rand(100)
    hmean=3*np.random.rand(100)
    H,T,Ehat,fphat,m0,Fetchhat,hhat=sm.parametricwaveshallow(windvel,Fetch,hmean,'karimpour','no')

    windvel=10
    Fetch=np.arange(1e3,1e6,1000)
    hmean=3
    H,T,Ehat,fphat,m0,Fetchhat,hhat=sm.parametricwaveshallow(windvel,Fetch,hmean,'karimpour','yes')
