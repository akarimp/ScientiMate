    Hm0,Hm0sea,Hm0swell,Tp,Tpsea,Tpswell,fp,fseparation,f,Syy=scientimate.SeaSwellFun(input,fs,duration,nfft,h,fmin,fmax,ftailcorrection,tailpower,fminswell,fmaxswell,mincutoff,maxcutoff,tailcorrection,dispout)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Separate sea wave from swell wave

INPUT
-----

input=importdata('h.mat')
                                Load water depth (h)/surface elevation (Eta) data and rename it "input" in (m)
fs=10
                                Sampling frequency that data collected at in (Hz)
duration=1024
                                Duration time that data collected in input in each burst in second
nfft=2^10
                                NFFT for Fast Fourier Transform
h=1
                                Mean water depth in (m)
fmin=0.04
                                Minimum frequency for cut off the lower part of spectra
fmax=1
                                Maximum frequency for cut off the upper part of spectra
ftailcorrection=1
                                Frequency that diagnostic tail apply after that (typically set at 2.5fm, fm=1/Tm01)
tailpower=-5
                                Power that diagnostic tail apply based on that (-3 for shallow water to -5 for deep water)
fminswell=0.1
                                Minimum frequency that is used for Tpswell calculation
fmaxswell=0.25
                                Maximum frequency that swell can have, It is about 0.2 in Gulf of Mexico
mincutoff='off'
                                Define if to cut off the spectra below fmin
                                    mincutoff='off': Cutoff off

                                    mincutoff='on': Cutoff on
maxcutoff='off'
                                Define if to cut off the spectra beyond fmax
                                    maxcutoff='off': Cutoff off

                                    maxcutoff='on': Cutoff on
tailcorrection='off'
                                Define if to apply diagnostic tail correction or not 
                                    tailcorrection='off': Not apply

                                    tailcorrection='jonswap': JONSWAP Spectrum tail

                                    tailcorrection='tma': TMA Spectrum tail
dispout='on'
                                Define to display outputs or not ('off': not display, 'on': display)
