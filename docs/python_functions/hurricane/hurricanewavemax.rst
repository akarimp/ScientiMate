Description
-----------

Calculate hurricane maximum wave height and wave period at a location of maximum wind 

Inputs
------

xCenter
    x (longitude) of hurricane center (track)
yCenter
    y (latitude) of hurricane center (track)
Pc
    Hurricane central surface pressure in (Pa)
Vmax
    | Maximum hurricane 1-min averaged wind velocity at surface level in (m/s)
    | It can be estimated from Vmax=3.44*(1010-Pc*1e-2)^0.644; where Pc is in (Pa)
    | and, Vmax is 1-min averaged wind at a 10-m elevation in (m/s) (Atkinson & Holliday, 1977)
    | Hurricane translation velocity (forward velocity) needs to be removed from Vmax before applying (e.g. Hu et al., 2012)
    | Hurricane translation velocity (forward velocity) needs to be added after rotational velocity is calculated
Rknown
    | Radius that hurricane wind velocity is known at that radius in (m)
    | Rknown should be larger than radius associated to Vgmax
VgRknown
    Hurricane wind velocity at the gradient level which is known at radius Rknown in (m/s)
Pn=101325
    | Ambient surface pressure (external pressure) in (Pa)
    | Standard atmosphere pressure is 101325 (Pa) 
    | Typical value: Pn=101500 (Pa) for the western North Pacific, Pn= 101000 (Pa) for the North Atlantic
    | (Batke et al., 2014)
Rhoa=1.204
    Air density at the gradient level in (kg/m3)
VgToVCoeff=0.8
    | Coefficient to convert gradient wind velocity to wind velocity at 10 m above surface as: 
    | V=VgToVCoeff*Vg, if VgToVCoeff=1, then V=Vg
G=0.88
    | Wind gust factor to convert 1-min averaged wind to 10-min averaged wind
    | e.g. Young (2017); Liu et al. (2017)
    | G=U(600s)/U(60s), therefore U(600s)=G*U(60s)
    | G=1/1.1; based on Powell and Houston (1996)
    | G=1/1.08; based on Harper (2013)
    | G=0.88; based on World Meteorological Organization (2015)
    | G=1/1.08 to 1/1.16; based on Liu et al. (2017)
Vt=0
    Hurricane central translational velocity in (m/s)
CalcMethod='young13'
    | Hurricane maximum wave height and period calculation method 
    | 'spm': Use method by Shore Protection Manual (SPM),
    |     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1984) in deep water
    | 'young88': Use method by Young (1988)
    | 'young13': Use method by Young & Vinoth (2013)
RVmaxCalcMethod='holland'
    | Method for calculating a hurricane radius of the maximum wind from known velocity and its radius
    | 'rankine': Velocity is calculated using modiÔ¨Åed Rankine vortex model, Depperman (1947)
    | 'holland': Velocity is calculated using using Holland (1980)
    | 'demaria': Velocity is calculated using using DeMaria (1987)
    | 'slosh': Velocity is calculated using using SLOSH model by Jelesnianski et al. (1992)
    | 'emanuel': Velocity is calculated using using Emanuel and Rotunno (2011)
dispout='no'
    | Define to display outputs or not
    | 'imagesc': 2 dimensional plot using imagesc or imshow
    | 'pcolor': 2 dimensional plot using pcolor
    | 'contour': 2 dimensional contour plot, number of contour=ncolor
    | 'no': not display 
    | Use dispout='no' if calculation mesh is not 2d array
    | if there is more than one time step, only the last one is plotted

Outputs
-------

Hsmax
    Hurricane maximum significant wave height in (m) 
Tmax
    | Hurricane maximum wave period in (s) 
    | For all methods excepth for 'spm': Tmax=Tpmax where, Tpmax is a maximum peak wave period
    | For 'spm' method: Tmax=Tsmax, where Tsmax is a maximum significant wave period (Ts=0.95Tp)
RVmax
    Distance (radius) from hurricane center to a location of maximum hurricane wind velocity (m)
