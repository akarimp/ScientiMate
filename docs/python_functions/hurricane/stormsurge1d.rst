scientimate.stormsurge1d
========================

.. code:: python

    Eta, x, maxsurgeheight, L = scientimate.stormsurge1d(h0, U10, m=0, dispout='no')

Description
-----------

Calculate one dimensional storm surge using Dean Dalrymple (1991) method

Inputs
------

h0
    Deep-water depth in (m), 
U10
    10-min averaged wind velocity at 10 meter above a surface in (m/s)
m=0
    | Bed slope
    | Note: m=h0/L, where L is a length of the continental shelf in (m)
dispout='no'
    Define to display outputs or not ('yes': display, 'no': not display)

Outputs
-------

Eta
    Surge height along a x axis in (m)
x
    | Points on x axis in (m) 
    | x=0 located at a far-end of the water boundary
    | x=L located at a coastline
maxsurgeheight
    Maximum surge height at a coastline (x=L) in (m)
L
    | Length of the continental shelf in (m)
    | L=h0/m if m is not zero
    | L=50000 if m is zero (L=50000 meter for the hurricane Katrina)

Examples
--------

.. code:: python

    import scientimate as sm

    h0=42 #Example: h0=42 m for the hurricane Katrina
    U10=40 #Example: U10=40 m/s for the hurricane Katrina 
    m=0.00084
    Eta,x,maxsurgeheight,L=sm.stormsurge1d(h0,U10,m,'yes')
