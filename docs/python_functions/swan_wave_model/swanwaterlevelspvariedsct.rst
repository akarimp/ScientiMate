scientimate.swanwaterlevelspvariedsct
=====================================

.. code:: python

    swanwaterlevel, waterlevelpoint = scientimate.swanwaterlevelspvariedsct(xgrid, ygrid, xpoint, ypoint, waterlevel, savedata='no', outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl', outfilelocation=None, CalcMethod='linear')

Description
-----------

| Generate SWAN water level file for spatially varied water level from scattered input data
| This function can be used for any other scalar variable as well

Inputs
------

xgrid
    x (longitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
ygrid
    y (latitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
xpoint
    | x (longitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
ypoint
    | y (latitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
waterlevel
    | Water level (or any scalar variable) at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    |     1st row (i.e. [1,:]) is 1st time step, 2nd row (i.e. [2,:]) is 2nd time step, ...
    |     Example: waterlevel(1,:) is the water level data for all points at the first time step
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in those locations
    |     L should be L>=3
    |     1st column (i.e. [:,1]) is 1st point, 2nd column (i.e. [:,2]) is 2nd point, 3rd column (i.e. [:,3]) is 3rd point, ...
    |     Example: waterlevel(:,1) is the water level data for all time steps at the first point
savedata='no'
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwaterlevel.wl'
    | outfilename should have '.wl' extension
    | In case of using other scalar varable than water level, use proper name and extension
outfilelocation=pwd
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python
CalcMethod='linear'
    | Interpolation method 
    | 'linear': Use default or 'linear' method to interpolate
    | 'nearest': Use nearest neighbor method to interpolate

Outputs
-------

swanwaterlevel
    | Spatially varied water level data (or any scalar variable) formated for SWAN
    | Water level data at each time step is assigned into the grid points
waterlevelpoint
    | Nearest interpolated water level (or any scalar variable) at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in those locations

Examples
--------

.. code:: python

    import scientimate as sm
    import numpy as np

    xgrid,ygrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-91,-90,100),np.linspace(28,30,100))
    xpoint=[-90.5,-90.3,-90.7] #Data are known at 3 locations
    ypoint=[29.2,29,28.8] #Data are known at 3 locations
    waterlevel=[[0.5,0.55,0.6],[0.64,0.69,0.74],[0.7,0.75,0.8],[0.4,0.45,0.5]] #Data for 4 time steps
    savedata='no'
    outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    outfilelocation=None
    CalcMethod='linear'
    swanwaterlevel,waterlevelpoint=sm.swanwaterlevelspvariedsct(xgrid,ygrid,xpoint,ypoint,waterlevel,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod)


    xgrid,ygrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-91,-90,100),np.linspace(28,30,100))
    xpoint=[-90.5,-90.3,-90.7] #Data are known at 3 locations
    ypoint=[29.2,29,28.8] #Data are known at 3 locations
    waterlevel=[0.5,0.55,0.6] #Data for 1 time step
    savedata='no'
    outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    outfilelocation=None
    CalcMethod='linear'
    swanwaterlevel,waterlevelpoint=sm.swanwaterlevelspvariedsct(xgrid,ygrid,xpoint,ypoint,waterlevel,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod)
