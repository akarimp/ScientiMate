scientimate.swanwaterlevelspvariedgrid
======================================

.. code:: python

    swanwaterlevel = scientimate.swanwaterlevelspvariedgrid(xgrid, ygrid, xpointgrid, ypointgrid, waterlevelgrid, savedata='no', outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl', outfilelocation=None, CalcMethod='linear')

Description
-----------

| Generate SWAN water level file for spatially varied water level from gridded input data
| This function can be used for any other scalar variable as well

Inputs
------

xgrid
    x (longitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
ygrid
    y (latitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
xpointgrid
    x (longitude) of the locations that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in those locations as a [K*L] array
ypointgrid
    y (latitude) of the locations that water level (or any scalar variable) is known in those locations as a [K*L] array
waterlevelgrid
    | Water level (or any scalar variable) at (xpointgrid,ypointgrid) as a [K*L*P] array
    | P is number of time steps for a time series
savedata='no'
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwaterlevel.wl'
    | outfilename should have '.wl' extension
    | In case of using other scalar varable than water level, use proper name and extension
outfilelocation=pwd
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python
CalcMethod='linear'
    | Interpolation method 
    | 'linear': Use default or 'linear' method to interpolate
    | 'nearest': Use nearest neighbor method to interpolate

Outputs
-------

swanwaterlevel
    | Spatially varied water level data (or any scalar variable) formated for SWAN
    | Water level data at each time step is assigned into the grid points

Examples
--------

.. code:: python

    import scientimate as sm
    import numpy as np

    xgrid,ygrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-91,-90,100),np.linspace(28,30,100))
    xpointgrid,ypointgrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-92,-89,100),np.linspace(27,31,100))
    waterlevelgrid=0.5+(0.6-0.5)*np.random.rand(100,100,4) #Data for 4 time steps
    savedata='no'
    outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    outfilelocation=None
    CalcMethod='linear'
    swanwaterlevel=sm.swanwaterlevelspvariedgrid(xgrid,ygrid,xpointgrid,ypointgrid,waterlevelgrid,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod)


    xgrid,ygrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-91,-90,100),np.linspace(28,30,100))
    xpointgrid,ypointgrid=np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-92,-89,100),np.linspace(27,31,100))
    waterlevelgrid=0.5+(0.6-0.5)*np.random.rand(100,100) #Data for 1 time step
    savedata='no'
    outfilename='swanwaterlevel.wl'
    outfilelocation=None
    CalcMethod='linear'
    swanwaterlevel=sm.swanwaterlevelspvariedgrid(xgrid,ygrid,xpointgrid,ypointgrid,waterlevelgrid,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation,CalcMethod)
