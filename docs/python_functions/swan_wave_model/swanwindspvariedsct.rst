===============================

.. code:: python

    swanwind, windvelpoint, winddirpoint = scientimate.swanwindspvariedsct(xgrid, ygrid, xpoint, ypoint, windvel, winddir, winddirtype='mete', windvelmin=0, savedata='no', outfilename='swanwind.wnd', outfilelocation=None, CalcMethod='linear')

Description
-----------

Generate SWAN wind file for spatially varied wind from scattered input data

Inputs
------

xgrid
    x (longitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
ygrid
    y (latitude) of output grid points as a [M*N] array
xpoint
    | x (longitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that wind is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
ypoint
    | y (latitude) of the location (such as meteorological station) that wind is known in that location
    | as a [L] array
    | 1st element is 1st point, 2nd element is 2nd point, 3rd element is 3rd point, ...
windvel
    | Wind velocity as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    |     1st row (i.e. [1,:]) is 1st time step, 2nd row (i.e. [2,:]) is 2nd time step, ...
    |     Example: windvel(1,:) is the wind velocity data for all points at the first time step
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind velocity is known in those locations
    |     L should be L>=3
    |     1st column (i.e. [:,1]) is 1st point, 2nd column (i.e. [:,2]) is 2nd point, 3rd column (i.e. [:,3]) is 3rd point, ...
    |     Example: windvel(:,1) is the wind velocity data for all time steps at the first point
winddir
    | Wind direction as a [K*L] array in (Degree)
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    |     1st row (i.e. [1,:]) is 1st time step, 2nd row (i.e. [2,:]) is 2nd time step, ...
    |     Example: windvel(1,:) is the wind direction data for all points at the first time step
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind direction is known in those locations
    |     L should be L>=3
    |     1st column (i.e. [:,1]) is 1st point, 2nd column (i.e. [:,2]) is 2nd point, 3rd column (i.e. [:,3]) is 3rd point, ...
    |     Example: windvel(:,1) is the wind direction data for all time steps at the first point
winddirtype='mete'
    | Define wind direction type
    | 'mete': meteorological wind direction 
    |     Meteorological direction represents a direction wind comes from and is measured counter-clockwise from the North
    |     0 (degree): from North, 90 (degree): from East, 180 (degree): from South, 270 (degree): from West
    | 'trig': trigonometric wind direction
windvelmin=0
    Minimum allowed wind velocity
savedata='no'
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwind.wnd'
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwind.wnd'
    | outfilename should have '.wnd' extension
outfilelocation=pwd
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python
CalcMethod='linear'
    | Interpolation method 
    | 'linear': Use default or 'linear' method to interpolate
    | 'nearest': Use nearest neighbor method to interpolate

Outputs
-------

swanwind
    | Spatially varied wind velocity data formated for SWAN
    | Wind velocity data at each time step is assigned into the grid points
windvelpoint
    | Nearest interpolated wind velocity at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind velocity is known in those locations
winddirpoint
    | Nearest interpolated wind direction at (xpoint,ypoint) as a [K*L] array
    | K is number of time steps for a time series
    | L is number of points (such as meteorological stations) that wind direction is known in those locations
