scientimate.swanvectorvarspconst
================================

.. code:: python

    swanvectorvariable = scientimate.swanvectorvarspconst(Vx, Vy, savedata='no', outfilename='swanwind.wnd', outfilelocation=None)

Description
-----------

Generate SWAN file for spatially constant vector variable

Inputs
------

Vx
    | Variable in x direction (x component of input variable)
    | If size of Vx>1, then it is considered as a time series
    | 1st element is 1st time step, 2nd element is 2nd time step, ...
Vy
    | Variable in y direction (y component of input variable)
    | Should have a same size as Vx
savedata='no'
    | Define if save data in a file or not
    | 'no': does not save 
    | 'yes': save data as ascii file
outfilename='swanwind.wnd'
    | Name of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'swanwind.wnd'
    | outfilename should have proper name and extension
outfilelocation=pwd
    Location of output file between ' ' mark, example: 'C:\' in MATLAB, or 'C:/' in Python

Outputs
-------

swanvectorvariable
    | Spatially constant vector variable formated for SWAN
    | Note: Vector variable at each time step is assigned into 4 points,
    |     assuming the vector variable domain is defined by 4 points, one at each corner

Examples
--------

.. code:: python

    import scientimate as sm

    windvelx=[10.5,10.6,10.55] #Data for 3 time steps
    windvely=[2.5,2.6,2.55] #Data for 3 time steps
    savedata='no'
    outfilename='swanwind.wnd'
    outfilelocation=None
    swanvectorvariable=sm.swanvectorvarspconst(windvelx,windvely,savedata,outfilename,outfilelocation)
